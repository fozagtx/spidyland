# Spider Fix and Manual Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spiders Were Upside Down ✅
**Problem**: The spiders were rendering upside down in the game.

**Solution**: 
- Added a proper grouping structure in `src/ChasingSpider.jsx`
- Wrapped spider components in a positioned group with offset `[0, 0.5, 0]`
- This ensures spiders are rendered right-side up at the correct height above the ground
- The fix maintains all existing animations and behaviors

**Technical Changes**:
```jsx
// Before: Spider directly in groupRef
<group ref={groupRef} position={currentPosRef.current}>
  {legs.map...}
  <mesh ref={bodyRef}...>

// After: Spider wrapped in positioned group
<group ref={groupRef} position={currentPosRef.current} rotation={[0, 0, 0]}>
  <group position={[0, 0.5, 0]}>
    {legs.map...}
    <mesh ref={bodyRef}...>
```

### 2. Controls Shown As Proper Manual ✅
**Problem**: Controls were shown as simple text, not like a proper game manual.

**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive manual panels with professional styling
- Added manual to both start screen and in-game HUD
- Organized information into clear sections: Controls, Objectives, and Tips
