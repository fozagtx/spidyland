6. Try to get the highest score!

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Spider Realism
- **Before**: Light-colored, static spider with white/gray appearance
- **After**: Dark, menacing spiders with black/red color scheme, glowing red eyes, enhanced texture detail, and realistic animations

### Gameplay
- **Before**: Static showcase with no interaction
- **After**: Full chase game with player controls, collectibles, AI enemies, and scoring system

### Audio
- **Before**: No sound
- **After**: Comprehensive sound system with footsteps, spider sounds, ambient atmosphere, and collection effects

## 🚀 Technical Achievements

1. **Integrated Tone.js** for procedural audio synthesis
2. **Implemented chase AI** with smooth tracking and rotation
3. **Created player control system** supporting keyboard and touch
4. **Built treasure collection mechanics** with respawning
5. **Enhanced 3D models** with improved PBR materials
6. **Optimized performance** for smooth 60 FPS gameplay
7. **Added game state management** with React hooks
8. **Implemented collision detection** for treasure pickup
9. **Created dynamic lighting system** with multiple light sources
10. **Built responsive UI** with game information

## 🎯 Game Loop

```
1. Player moves using controls
2. Position updates in real-time
3. Spiders track player position
4. Spiders move toward player with AI
5. Check for treasure collision
6. Play appropriate sounds
7. Update score on collection
8. Respawn treasure at new location
9. Repeat at 60 FPS
```
