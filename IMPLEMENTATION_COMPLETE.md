### State Management
- **Game State**: useState hooks for game status
- **Score**: Real-time tracking with setState
- **Timer**: 60-second countdown with setInterval
- **Fireflies**: Array state with collected flags
- **Web Shots**: Dynamic array of active projectiles
- **Leaderboard**: localStorage persistence

### Physics System
- **Movement**: Force-based with velocity and friction
- **Collision**: Distance-based detection
- **Camera**: Smooth lerp following
- **Animations**: useFrame for 60 FPS updates

## 🌐 Blockchain Integration

### Mock Implementation (Current)
```javascript
TokenContract.js
├── connect() - MetaMask connection
├── mintTokens() - Mock minting
├── generateMockSignature() - Hash generation
└── getBalance() - Mock balance check
```

### Production Requirements
1. Deploy SPDR_CONTRACT_EXAMPLE.sol to Somnia
2. Update contract address in TokenContract.js
3. Implement backend API for score verification
4. Add real signature verification
5. Enable actual on-chain minting
