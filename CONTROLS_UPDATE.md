# Game Controls Update - VR-Style Dynamic Movement

## Changes Made

This update completely overhauls the game controls to provide a real VR-like experience with dynamic, physics-based player movement instead of hardcoded values.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Physics-Based Movement System
- **Before**: Used `setInterval` with hardcoded movement speed of 0.15
- **After**: Implemented proper physics with:
  - Acceleration force (15 units)
  - Maximum speed limit (8 units) 
  - Friction (0.85 multiplier)
  - Velocity-based movement that feels natural and responsive

### 2. Dynamic Camera System
- **Before**: Used OrbitControls with manual camera rotation
- **After**: Implemented auto-following camera that:
  - Smoothly follows player position with lerp interpolation
  - Automatically tracks player movement
  - Provides cinematic third-person view
  - No manual camera control needed (true VR style)

### 3. Real-Time Frame Updates
- **Before**: Movement updated every 16ms via `setInterval`
- **After**: Uses `useFrame` hook for true real-time updates synced with render loop
  - Smoother movement
  - Better performance
  - Proper delta time handling

### 4. Enhanced Player Behavior
- **Dynamic rotation**: Player smoothly rotates based on movement direction
- **Speed-based animations**: Walking animation speed increases with velocity
- **Realistic bobbing**: Head bob intensity scales with movement speed
- **Smooth interpolation**: All rotations use lerping for fluid motion

## New Architecture

### PlayerController Component
New component (`src/PlayerController.jsx`) that:
- Manages all player input (keyboard, touch)
- Calculates physics (velocity, acceleration, friction)
- Handles boundary checking
- Updates camera position dynamically
- Detects treasure collection
- Passes state to visual Player component

### Updated Player Component
Enhanced (`src/Player.jsx`) to:
- Accept velocity data for dynamic animations
- Calculate rotation from actual movement direction
- Scale animations based on movement speed
- Smoother transitions between states

### Updated GameScene
Simplified (`src/GameScene.jsx`) to:
- Remove hardcoded movement logic
- Use new PlayerController component
- Remove OrbitControls (no longer needed)
- Cleaner state management

## Technical Details

### Movement Physics
```javascript
acceleration = inputForce * 15
velocity += acceleration * deltaTime
velocity *= friction (0.85)
velocity = clamp(velocity, maxSpeed: 8)
position += velocity * deltaTime
```

### Camera Following
```javascript
targetPosition = playerPosition + offset(0, 15, 20)
camera.position.lerp(targetPosition, 0.1)
camera.lookAt(playerPosition)
```

### Player Rotation
```javascript
movementDirection = currentPosition - lastPosition
targetAngle = atan2(direction.x, direction.z)
rotation.y += angleDiff * 0.15  // Smooth rotation
```

## Benefits

1. **More Realistic**: Movement feels like controlling a real character
2. **Better Feedback**: Visual feedback from speed-based animations
3. **Smoother**: No jerky movements, everything interpolated
4. **VR-Ready**: Camera behavior suitable for VR experiences
5. **Better Performance**: Frame-synced updates instead of arbitrary intervals
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch controls integrated seamlessly

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move in respective directions with acceleration
- **Touch & Drag**: Mobile touch controls with force-based movement
- **Camera**: Automatically follows player (no manual control needed)

## User Experience

The game now feels like a proper 3D action game with:
- Responsive, dynamic controls
- Cinematic camera following
- Natural movement physics
- Smooth visual feedback
- Immersive VR-style experience
